### Parameters

# Help Related
-help: Display help.

# Input Files
-file: Input file of NGS reads.
-ref_file: Reference file.

# Aligning Engine
-DIVCON: Use divide-and-conquer linear space method. This parameter is valid only if -ALIGN_MAX is 1. (default: false)

# Aligning Parameters
-s0: Mismatching score. (default: -3)
-s1: Matching score. (default: +1)
-u: Gap-extending penalty. (default: -2)
-v: Gap-opening penalty. (default: -5)
-alg_type: Method to scoring unaligned parts between aligned segments in query sequence and reference (-alg_type local|imbed|contain|local_imbed). (default: local)
-per_thres: Percentage threshold of repeated reads. The same read may repeat many times in the file. Percentage of a read is calculated by (repeated # of the read in the file)/(total # of reads in the file). Reads with percentages less than -per_thres are excluded from analyses. (default: 0.0)

# Output Options
-mode: The method to explain the indel (-mode overlapping|nonoverlapping). (default: nonoverlapping)
-ALIGN_MAX: The maximally reserved number of best alignments for each read (Each read may have several best alignments to the reference). (default: 5)

# Analyze Indels
-indel : Post-analysis for alignments. (default : false)

# EM Configs
-EM : Predict the cut distribution by EM algorithm. (default: false)
-ini_alpha: Path to the file used to initialize the distribution of the left ligation ends. If not specified, a uniform distribution over the ligation range will be used. Note that the file must be consistent with the information in reference sequences.
-ini_beta: Similar as -ini_alpha but for the right ligation ends.
-ini_pi: Path to the file used to initialize the distribution of the middle insertions. If not specified, a uniform distribution over all possible middle insertions upper to length specified by -MID_MAX will be used.
-MID_MAX: The maximal length of middle insertion. (default: 0)
-thres: The terminal threshold for EM algorithm. (default: 0.000001)

# Parallel Options
-SEQ_BATCH: Set the number of reads passed in one time. (default: 300)
-THR_NUM: Thread number. (default: the hardware available threads)
