# Usage
## demultiplex reads
demultiplex.sh fqR1 fqR2 spliter1 spliter2 sgRNAfile minscoreR1 minscoreR2 ref12 minQueryR2 >fqR1.demultiplex
## align reads over spliter2 (spliters are used to demultiplex reads)
barcode_align.sh fqR1 ext1up ext2up totalCount <fqR1.demultiplex >fqR1.alg 3>fqR1.table
## call kpLogo
run_kpLogo.sh fqR1 method(thres|weight|back) threshold
## Count percentage of -4
trouble_shooting.r fqR1 score_thres(default: -Inf)
## render html
barcode_render.sh fqR1 ext1up ext2up ref1len

# Output
fqR1.count: the count of duplicates in the input file
fqR1.not_find: non-duplicate reads cannot find spliter1/2, or has unpaired spliter1/2, or has too short query
fqR1.demultiplex: non-duplicate reads labeled by spliter2
fqR1.alg: alignments of non-duplicate reads over spliter2
fqR1.table: informative table of alignments of non-duplicate reads over spliter2
