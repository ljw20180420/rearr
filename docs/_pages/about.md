This is the github page for repository [sx_lcy][sx_lcy] includes a core chimeric alignment engine `rearr`. Although `rearr` can be used for any chimeric alignment job in theory, [sx_lcy][sx_lcy] is mainly used to analyze CRISPR editing data. Besides `rearr`, [sx_lcy][sx_lcy] also includes a demultiplex tool for sequencing results of sgRNA libraries, and an out of box web site deployed by docker. The website contains a UI visualizing the whole workflow of demultiplexing and aligning. It also contains some apps for visualization and post process.
